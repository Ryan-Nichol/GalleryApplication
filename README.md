# GalleryApplication
Created by: Ryan Nichol

To see the full functionality of the application I recommend you watch the example_video.mp4 located in the root folder of the project.

The GalleryApplication fetches images from an API, then displays a single image at a time on the screen. To go to the next image press the next button. To go to the previous image press the previous button.
